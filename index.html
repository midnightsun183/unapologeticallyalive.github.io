		    <p>The name of this blog came to me as I was on the elliptical in the gym one day. Corey had been pestering me to start a blog, and I felt that first I needed a name. That may not be everyoneâ€™s first step, but I needed something that would encapsulate the diverse range of topics that I want to write about. As I was ruminating over this issue, I recalled a book that I saw about two months ago in the London airport as I was waiting to get on my flight to Seville called The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck: How to Stop Spending Time You Don't Have with People  You Don't Like Doing Things You Don't Want to Do*. Long title, I know. When I saw that book, I knew it was written for me. It was written for me because I give waaaaaay too many fucks.</p>
