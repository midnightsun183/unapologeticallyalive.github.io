      <p>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

​Luke 1:46-55
The Magnificat is a poem for our times, but not in the way it is often recited and performed. 

Usually sung in dulcet tones, controlled and perfect, the Magnificat is a frequent part of liturgical services in any number of Christian denominations. But in interacting with it in this way, have we missed the point? Do the sweet notes and sanitized environment in which we experience this poem mask its true power? 

My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour

Ok, sounds nice enough. 

For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.

Alright, more recognition of God’s greatness and some praise. Good stuff. Pretty par for the course in any liturgy. 

... he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.

Hold up. Stop. Read that again. 

The mighty will be put down. 

The lowly raised up. 

The hungry filled. 

The rich sent away empty. 

This poem is not some rosey, innocent spiritual reflection sung by a happy-go-lucky young girl with a perfect first century life. 

This poem is the revolutionary declaration of change, the courageous shout of a young woman of color who finds herself pregnant, out of wedlock, in a society that will not forgive such a transgression, and who proclaims the power and justice of the Lord to those who have been oppressed by the powers and principalities of this world. 

I am often frustrated when I hear the magnificat sung or recited as part of the liturgy, not because it is not important, but because it is SO important. SO powerful. And the manner in which it is most often performed dilutes this power. 

This morning I heard it read as the closing to a sermon on Pentecost, on the indwelling, and the power, and the movement of the Spirit. On the ongoing fight for racial justice and equality in America. On the mighty being put down. On the lowly being raised up. On the hungry being filled and on the rich being sent away empty. 

I’m not sure if the Magnificat is for every Sunday, or if it is for every liturgy. I’m not sure if there is a time for it to be sung sweetly and recited with the sort of happiness that seems to pervade its essence in most of its performances. I think that these recitations and performances feed our complacency, feed our comfort with words that for many of us should stir discomfort. I think they also feed our comfortable image of Mary as some sweet, innocent girl who was compliant. Who did what she was told. Who submitted. 

And I believe that nothing could be further from the truth. 

To me, the Magnificat feels more raw than that. It feels less polished, less sanitized. It feels like the kind of declaration, the kind of prophecy that SHOULD make us uncomfortable, because change on the scale and of the sort that it describes is NEVER comfortable. It is NEVER easy. And it NEVER takes us “back to normal.” 

It is hard. 

It hurts. 

It is messy. 

It can feel out of control. 

As Mary would experience not long after declaring this prophecy, the birthing of something new and good and life-giving into the world is all of these things. And it is also worth it. 

The Magnificat is a poem for our times. But only if we can really hear it. </p>
