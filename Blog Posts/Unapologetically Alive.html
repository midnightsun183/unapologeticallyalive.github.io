        The name of this blog came to me as I was on the elliptical in the gym one day. Corey had been pestering me to start a blog, and I felt that first I needed a name. That may not be everyone’s first step, but I needed something that would encapsulate the diverse range of topics that I want to write about. As I was ruminating over this issue, I recalled a book that I saw about two months ago in the London airport as I was waiting to get on my flight to Seville called The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck: How to Stop Spending Time You Don't Have with People  You Don't Like Doing Things You Don't Want to Do*. Long title, I know. When I saw that book, I knew it was written for me. It was written for me because I give waaaaaay too many fucks.
        <br>
				<br>
        I care about almost everything. A lot of the things that I care about are important, like climate change, minority rights, and education. A lot of the things that I care about are not so important, like what strangers on the street think of me, or how I look when I’m doing a workout at the gym, or whether we make it to all of the museums on my list while we’re on vacation. In short, I give too many fucks.   
        <br>
				<br>
        As I thought about this I realized that caring too much is very closely related to apologizing for everything when it’s not perfect or what people expect. I do this ALL THE TIME. I apologize for not looking very good if someone catches me off guard and I “look a mess”, i.e., with my hair thrown up in a bun and no make-up. I apologize if my house isn’t pristine when someone comes over (Hello? I live there. Of course my house has the stuff that is the result of human LIFE). I apologize if I am a little bit early or a little bit late, or if I might have possibly, maybe inconvenienced anyone in any way. 
        <br>
				<br>
        I also apologize when I don’t really mean it. What do I mean by that? Well, if I say something that someone disagrees with, I might start out with “I’m sorry, but….”. This may not seem like a  big one, but why apologize if you aren’t sorry about what you are about to say? And if you really are sorry about it, should you actually say it?
        <br>
				<br>
        When I finally came up with the name Unapologetically Alive I almost immediately rejected it. Why? Because it sounded too… aggressive? Self-absorbed? Arrogant? I actually thought that the name, Unapologetically Alive, was something that I might have to apologize for. I was immediately hit by self-doubt, like I needed to apologize for being confident…. just how crazy is that? 
        <br>
				<br>
        Once I realized how silly that was, I knew that this was the name that the blog needed to have. I need it for myself. I need to remind myself that I don’t have to apologize for being me, for being who I am. I don’t need to apologize for how I look or how my house looks. I don’t need to apologize for being a minute early or a minute late. It’s 60 seconds of your life. You waste more time than that on Facebook every day. I don’t need to apologize for what I believe or what I think. My opinions are valid. I have thought long and hard about them, and have often come to a conclusion only after a long period of reflection. 
        <br>
				<br>
        In short, I don’t need to apologize for living and being me. So here it goes. Here’s to being wholly and unapologetically alive!

	      "You know what I really wonder about?" she asked. "Whether he could hear what they said about him. Or hear them laughing. He was conscious for a while, you know. I wonder if he heard them laughing and just gave up. Sometimes, it's hard not to."
