This means that in a crowded grocery store or a football stadium we are amongst beautiful children of God who God formed to be something a little different from male or female. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c12 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Historically, people who were born with ambiguous genitalia were </span><span class="c4">operated on at birth</span><span class="c4">, with surgery to make them look more classically male or female. The decision was taken from their hands, resulting in sometimes disastrous consequences at later points </span><span class="c4">in life. </span><span class="c12 c13">This changing of a person&rsquo;s outside prompted no moral outrage from Christians. There were no editorials, petitions, or cases brought before the Supreme Court to try to prevent doctors from changing these children. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c12 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c15 c17">Will you seek to serve Christ in all persons, loving your neighbor as yourself?</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c17 c4 c15"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c15">I will, with God&rsquo;s help. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c12 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c13">Medical practice in the United States in recent years has moved away from performing surgery at birth for patients with ambiguous genitalia, with the general consensus being that it is better to wait and let the child, or adult, make the decision to modify their body, or not, at a later point. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c12 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">But when adults whose genitalia are more recognizably male or female choose to modify their bodies, they are derided, ridiculed, and discriminated against by many of those same people who were curiously silent when doctors used to make similar modifications to the bodies of helpless children who could not consent. When adults make the choice to modify their bodies, it is somehow unacceptable to a large number of the followers of Christ.</span><span class="c12 c13">&nbsp;These adults don&rsquo;t fit the mold, you see, and they aren&rsquo;t the only ones. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c12 c13"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">An effeminate straight man or a butch lesbian also fall outside of traditional gender norms, and they are also left vulnerable to denial of treatment by medical professionals by this ruling. Your cousin Chris whose voice is too high and who never really developed that much facial hair? A doctor could refuse him a check-up based on his perception about Chris&rsquo; gender. Your aunt Diane who wears her hair short and doesn&rsquo;t have many curves? She could be denied treatment for ovarian cancer if a doctor decides that she doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;look&rdquo; female. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">And Chris&rsquo; doctor might not refuse him a check-up.

No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.&rdquo; The council then sent a letter with Paul and Barnabas to the churches in Antioch, Syria, and Cicilia clarifying the requirements for believers. They asked that they observe a much abbreviated version of the Law of Moses as a sort of cultural compromise between the strict separationist laws of the Jews and the more liberal cultural practices of the Gentiles. These observances were not meant to be a universal requirement for followers of Christ in all times and places, but a culturally specific mandate that allowed people with vastly different cultural practices to live and worship together in unity. </span></p><p class="c18 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p></div><div><p class="c18"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c7">&nbsp;Acts 8:26-40 The inclusivity shown in this passage to the eunuch is remarkable because Mosaic law forbade the entrance of eunuchs into the assembly of the Lord (Deut. 23:1).

At best they would be God-fearing &ldquo;others&rdquo;.
